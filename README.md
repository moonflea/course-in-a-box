## How to use GitHub to track XML-coded finding aids, built by P2PU
### UCLA Library Special Collections (LSC) Collection Management
This website (in draft form as of May 31, 2022) documents how findings aid versions will be tracked using GitHub. 

All existing finding aid EADs must be reuploaded to the OAC because they must be updated with new Primo permalinks and be linked to our descriptive practices statement. This provided the perfect opportunity to begin using GitHub to version our finding aids.

LSC currently has over 3000 finding aids divided into 4 divisions: Manuscripts, Biomedical Collections, University Archives, and Performing Arts. LSC has been collecting for over 75 years, resulting in multiple iterations of descriptions for our collections. Version control has been challenging, to say the least. 

Since the late 1990s, LSC's finding aids have been either created in, or rekeyed into, Encoded Archival Description (EAD), and saved as SGM and XML files. Because they are pure text files, GitHub is an excellent tool for tracking iterations of the files. 

The commit messages will be invaluable for letting Collections Management staff know the history of each finding aid file going forward. 

GitHub Issues will be useful as well. They can be used to track what needs to be changed in an individual collection, and can be assigned to the correct staff member.
